# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase in software development, emphasizing the documentation, analysis, and structuring of software requirements for a booking management system. It aims to provide a clear, professional, and comprehensive foundation for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and specifying what a software system should do. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that helps ensure the development team builds a system that meets stakeholders' needs. It involves identifying user expectations, system functionalities, constraints, and establishing a clear project scope. Proper Requirement Analysis reduces risks, avoids costly rework, and leads to higher-quality software products.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clear Project Scope:** Helps define what the system should and should not do, avoiding scope creep.
- **Improved Communication:** Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring everyone shares the same understanding.
- **Risk Reduction:** Early identification of potential problems and conflicts, reducing development costs and time.
- **Better Planning:** Provides a roadmap for development, testing, and delivery phases.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and document analysis.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Interacting with users to discover their needs and expectations more deeply.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Recording requirements clearly and precisely for reference and communication.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Organizing and analyzing requirements using models, diagrams, and prioritization.
- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements specify what the system should do. They define specific behaviors, functions, and features.
- Example: The system must allow users to search for available properties.
- Example: Users should be able to book a property with specified dates.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system performs certain functions, focusing on quality attributes.
- Example: The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- Example: The booking system must be available 99.9% of the time.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system, helping to clarify system functionality and user roles. They are useful for communicating system scope and requirements with stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by the user or customer. They ensure that requirements are testable and clearly understood.

**Example for Checkout Feature:**
- Users must be able to select a payment method and complete payment successfully.
- The system should confirm booking once payment is processed.
- Users should receive an email confirmation within 5 minutes of booking.
- The checkout process must be completed within 3 minutes for an average user.
